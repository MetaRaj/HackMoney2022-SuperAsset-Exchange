This project has been built on scaffold-eth.

Two contracts need to be deployed:
1) To deploy TradeableCashFlow, follow instructions as per NFTBillboard-userdata repo. 
2) To deploy MintableSuperToken: this has already been done. Please use the mintCST to mint your custome super token to the address of the deployed TradeableCashFlow above.

Front End: App.jsx is complete but still needs to be made more user friendly

Note: due to front end error: Access to fetch at 'https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check, I could not refine/finalise the front end.
